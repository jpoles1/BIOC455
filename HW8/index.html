<h3>Homework 8</h3>
<i>By: Jordan Poles</i>
<p>
  Herein we consider a birth-death process in which the birth rate is λ and the death rate is γ.
  Both values are constant, and λ < γ.
  Below, we derive the stationary probability distribution for the number of particles undergoing a birth-death process.
</p>

\[
  \text{It is known that }P_n = (1-\frac{\lambda}{\gamma})(\frac{\lambda}{\gamma})^n
  \\
  \frac{\lambda}{\gamma} \text{ is a value } [0, 1) \therefore \text{ system has a net negative flux.}
  \\
  
\]
