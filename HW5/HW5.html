<h3>Homework 5: Bistability</h3>
<p>Does the following system of two symmetric co-repressors exhibit bistable behaviour?</p>
<h4><i>Bistable System Diagram:</i></h4>

<p>
  We will begin by finding the fixed/stationary points of this system.
  A fixed point is defined as one where f(x) = x and therefore f'(x) = 0.
  When a system is bistable, there are two possible points where the system is at a fixed point.
</p>

\[
  \dot{x} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(y/c)} - \gamma x = 0 \quad\therefore\quad x = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(y/c))}
  \\
  \dot{y} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(x/c)} - \gamma y = 0 \quad\therefore\quad y = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(x/c))}
  \\
  x = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(\frac{\alpha}{\gamma c(1+(x/c))}))} = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma+\frac{\alpha}{c+x}}
  \\
  \alpha = x\gamma+x\frac{\alpha}{x+c} = \frac{x\gamma(x+c) + x\alpha}{x+c}
  \\
  \alpha c = x\gamma(x+c) + x\alpha - x\alpha = x^2\gamma + x\gamma c
  \\
  x^2\gamma + x\gamma c - \alpha c = 0;
  \\
  x = y = \frac{-c\gamma \pm sqrt(c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma)}{2\gamma}
  \\
\]

<p>
  We have now reduced our fixed points down to two values of x and y.
  The equations for the concentration of these two proteins are the same given the symetric nature of the system.
  We therefore derive conditions in which both of the proteins will be at fixed points:
</p>

\[
  \alpha,c \geq 0; \quad \gamma > 0
  \\
  c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma \geq 0
  \\
  -c\gamma \pm sqrt(c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma) \geq 0
\]

<p>
  If all of these conditions are met, then it is clear that we should have a pair of non-negative concentrations for both x and y proteins at which they will be at fixed points.
  When these two fixed points exist, then the system is bistable.
