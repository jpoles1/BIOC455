<h3>Homework 5: Bistability</h3>
<p>Does the following system of two symmetric co-repressors exhibit bistable behaviour?</p>
<h4><i>Bistable System Diagram:</i></h4>

<p>
  We will begin by finding the fixed/stationary points of this system.
  A fixed point is defined as one where f(x) = x and therefore f'(x) = 0.
  When a system is bistable, there are two possible points where the system is at a fixed point.

\[
  \dot{x} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(y/c)} - \gamma x = 0 \quad\therefore\quad x = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(y/c))}
  \\
  \dot{y} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(x/c)} - \gamma y = 0 \quad\therefore\quad y = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(x/c))}
  \\
  
\]
