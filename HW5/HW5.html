<h3>Homework 5: Bistability</h3>
<p>Does the following system of two symmetric co-repressors exhibit bistable behaviour?</p>
<h4><i>Bistable System Diagram:</i></h4>

<p>
  We will begin by finding the fixed/stationary points of this system.
  A fixed point is defined as one where f(x) = x and therefore f'(x) = 0.
  When a system is bistable, there are two possible points where the system is at a fixed point.
</p>

\[
  \dot{x} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(y/c)} - \gamma x = 0 \quad\therefore\quad x = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(y/c))}
  \\
  \dot{y} = \frac{\alpha}{1+(x/c)} - \gamma y = 0 \quad\therefore\quad y = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(x/c))}
  \\
  x = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma(1+(\frac{\alpha}{\gamma c(1+(x/c))}))} = \frac{\alpha}{\gamma+\frac{\alpha}{c+x}}
  \\
  \alpha = x\gamma+x\frac{\alpha}{x+c} = \frac{x\gamma(x+c) + x\alpha}{x+c}
  \\
  \alpha c = x\gamma(x+c) + x\alpha - x\alpha = x^2\gamma + x\gamma c
  \\
  x^2\gamma + x\gamma c - \alpha c = 0;
  \\
  x = y = \frac{-c\gamma \pm sqrt(c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma)}{2\gamma}
  \\
\]

<p>
  We have now reduced our fixed points down to two values of x and y.
  The equations for the concentration of these two proteins are the same given the symetric nature of the system.
  We therefore derive conditions in which both of the proteins will be at fixed points:
</p>

\[
  \alpha,c \geq 0; \quad \gamma > 0
  \\
  c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma \geq 0 \quad\therefore\quad \frac{c\gamma}{\alpha} \geq -4; \quad \text{which is always true.}
  \\
  -c\gamma \pm sqrt(c^2 \gamma^2+4\alpha c \gamma) \geq 0
  \\
  \pm sqrt(c^2\gamma^2 + 4 \alpha c \gamma)\geq c\gamma; \quad\text{only one of these two points.}
  \\
  \therefore\quad \text{this system cannot be bistable.}
\]

<p>
  Given that only the case where \(sqrt(c^2\gamma^2 + 4 \alpha c \gamma)\geq c\gamma\) can be true, then there is only one stable point at any given time in this system, and it is not bistable.
</p>
